## Problem
As a frontend developer, you may need to implement a slide-up drawer similar to the one in iOS. This drawer should be rendered as a sibling of the `<body>` element and be flexible enough to accept any UI components as its content.
## Solution
We use React with TypeScript and React Portals to create a slide-up drawer component. The drawer is styled with CSS for smooth animations and transitions.
## Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Better-organized code by rendering the drawer outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy.
2. **Reusability**: The drawer component can accept any children, making it highly reusable.
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type safety, reducing runtime errors.
4. **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions provide smooth slide-up and slide-down animations.
## Concepts
1. **React Portals**: Used to render the drawer as a sibling of the `<body>` element.
2. **TypeScript**: Adds static types for improved code quality and maintainability.
3. **CSS Transitions**: Used for smooth animations.
4. **React State Management**: `useState` hook is used to manage the open/close state of the drawer.
